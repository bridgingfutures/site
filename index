      <h2>How “temporary protection” for Ukrainians has turned into permanent temporariness in the UK</h2>
      <p class="meta">Draft note · December 2025</p>

      <p>
        Since 2022, the UK’s Ukraine visa schemes have moved quietly from
        genuine temporary protection to a form of <strong>permanent
        temporariness</strong>. In some ways this leaves Ukrainians, in the
        long term, worse off than people who arrive irregularly and are later
        granted protection.
      </p>

      <h3>2022 – emergency protection, clearly temporary</h3>
      <p>
        In early 2022, after Russia’s full-scale invasion, the UK launched
        Homes for Ukraine, the Ukraine Family Scheme and the Ukraine Extension
        Scheme. These visas were framed as emergency, time-limited protection
        and explicitly “not a route to settlement” in the Immigration Rules
        (Appendix Ukraine Scheme).
      </p>
      <p>
        At that point “temporary” sounded reasonable: short-term refuge during
        an acute crisis.
      </p>

      <h3>2023–24 – lives become long-term, status stays temporary</h3>
      <p>
        By 2023–24 many Ukrainians were no longer “passing through” the UK but
        living here in ordinary, long-term ways. The Government’s own ONS survey
        (fieldwork 15–22 April 2024) found that around 69% of adults on the
        Ukraine schemes were working. In a scenario where it is safe to return,
        about 68% said they intend to live in the UK most of the time; only 15%
        chose Ukraine.
      </p>

      <h3>Late 2024 – a crucial rules change</h3>
      <p>
        In late 2024 the Immigration Rules were amended so that time spent in
        the UK under the Ukraine visa schemes no longer counts towards the
        10-year Long Residence route. Even ten or more years of lawful residence
        on these visas can never qualify for long residence, purely because of
        the category.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was not an accident of drafting. It was a specific decision to
        exclude Ukrainians from the main safety-net route to settlement.
      </p>

      <h3>2025 – new asylum framework, Ukrainians outside it</h3>
      <p>
        In 2025 the Government’s policy statement “Restoring Order and Control”
        set out a new architecture built around core protection and
        “safe and legal routes” with 10- and 20-year routes to settlement or
        reviewable protection. The Home Secretary has repeatedly described the
        Ukraine schemes as “bespoke and always intended to be temporary”, and
        explicitly kept them outside this new framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, however, the Ukraine schemes look exactly like the kind of
        safe and legal route described in the policy paper: visas, full
        security checks, sponsorship, work, tax, children in UK schools.
      </p>

      <h3>The paradox of permanent temporariness</h3>
      <p>
        Today a person who arrived irregularly and is granted protection could,
        at least in theory, earn settlement after 20 years. A Ukrainian who
        arrived on a visa, passed all checks and has lived 10+ years on the
        Ukraine schemes may have no route to settlement at all, because those
        years are treated as if they do not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research already documents the real-life effects: job refusals and
        non-renewed contracts because employers are wary of short visas;
        difficulties renting and a higher risk of homelessness; adults unable
        to commit to higher education or long-term training; high levels of
        anxiety linked directly to repeated short extensions with no clear
        endpoint.
      </p>

      <p>
        The issue is no longer “temporary shelter during a war”. It is a
        conscious policy choice to keep a large, law-abiding group of residents
        in a permanently temporary status, with no point at which an integrated
        Ukrainian can stop being legally “temporary” and earn a secure future
        in the UK.
